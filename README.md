## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. 1. **[Fork the repository](https://github.com/your-repo-url/fork)** to your GitHub account.
2. **Open the project** in your preferred code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
1. Inside both `apps/backend` and `apps/site`, you will find `.env.example` files.
2. **Rename these files** to `.env`:
   - `apps/backend/.env.example` → `apps/backend/.env`
   - `apps/site/.env.example` → `apps/site/.env`
3. **Update the environment variables** with your specific configuration. Ensure you provide the correct values for PostgreSQL and other necessary services.

   Example `.env` file structure:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:1337
   ```

4. **Ensure your PostgreSQL database** is set up and running before proceeding.

```bash
export LICENSE_TOKEN='You will recive license on confirmation email'
```
```bash
 @padma:registry=https://api.keygen.sh/v1/accounts/88de7a21-b541-48e5-8727-f992ebeb43fa/artifacts/
 //api.keygen.sh/v1/accounts/88de7a21-b541-48e5-8727-f992ebeb43fa/artifacts/:_authToken=$LICENSE_TOKEN
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
From the root of your project directory, run the following command to install all dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 4: Run the Backend
1. Navigate to the root directory and run the backend using the following command:
   ```bash
   pnpm -F @padma/backend dev
   ```
2. **Strapi backend** will now be running at `http://localhost:1337`.

### Step 5: Run the Frontend
1. In a new terminal, run the frontend application:
   ```bash
   pnpm -F @padma/frontend dev
   ```
2. **Next.js frontend** will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
