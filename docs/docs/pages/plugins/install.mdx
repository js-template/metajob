## Step 1: Start from Scratch  

If you want to create a new Strapi project with the Padma plugin pre-installed, follow these steps:  

1. Run the following command to generate a fresh Strapi backend with the Padma plugin:  
   ```bash
   npx padma-backend my-project-backend
   ```  

2. Navigate into your newly created project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd my-project-backend
   ```  

3. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   yarn develop
   ```  

Your backend will be up and running, complete with the Padma plugin!

## Step 2: Use Padma with an Existing Strapi Setup  

If you already have a Strapi project and want to integrate the Padma plugin:  

1. Install the Padma backend plugin:  
   ```bash
   yarn add padma-backend-plugin
   ```  

2. Add the necessary components and configurations to your Strapi setup.  
   - Navigate to the **Components** and **Content-Type Builder** sections in the Strapi Admin UI.  
   - Add the components and content types required by Padma based on its documentation.  

3. Restart your Strapi server:  
   ```bash
   yarn develop
   ```  

The Padma plugin is now installed and ready to use in your existing Strapi setup.
