# ðŸš€ Getting Started


## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Padma Docs

Padma is a Next.js-based framework that enables you to easily build a frontend for a headless (or decoupled) Strapi with a Next.js full-stack site. Your Strapi backend serves its data via the REST API. The Padma framework is open-source and free to use.

## Requirements

To get started with Padma, you will need:

### 1. A Strapi Installation
By default, Padma provides an example Strapi site as the data source for every new project, so you can start working with this one.

You can also configure your own Strapi installation to be the site config setting. This can be hosted either locally on your development machine or on a web server. You can also use a site hosted on Strapi Cloud.

### 2. Node.js
If you don't already have Node.js, you can get it from the official site. This will also install npm and npx along with Node.js.

You will use these tools to run Padma commands during the setup and development of your project.

{/* ### 3. WordPress Experience (Optional)
If you are familiar with WordPress and how to install plugins and themes to customize your needs, the same concept applies here for the backend. You will need to install plugins to extend functionality, and you can customize the site content, settings, layouts, and related CSS. */}

### Testing Node.js Installation

To test if you have Node.js installed, open your terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
```
